# Tech-screen

This repo contains multiple apps.  The concept is to enable developers to pick and choose which tech problem(s) they would like to solve.

But first, a little bit about us...

## About ClearScore

At ClearScore we are not limited to the technology stack we can use. Our systems evolve quickly and choosing the right tools for the job is an important factor within our development cycle.

We are currently working with...
 * ES6 and ES7 throughout the codebase
 * React with Redux
 * Isomorphic / Universal SPA
 * PostCSS + CSS-modules for styling (legacy apps use SASS and BEM)
 * MEN (Mongo, Express, Node) stack websites
 * We build using the Webpack module bundler and Lerna package manager
 * Jest + Enzyme for Unit testing
 * We currently support the latest 2 versions of Edge, Chrome, Firefox and Safari (plus ie11)

## What we're looking for

 * A stylish solution
 * Clean, concise code
 * Unit Tests
 * Demonstration of CSS knowledge
 * A detailed README explaining assumptions / decisions
 * A live site we can see
