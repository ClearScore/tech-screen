# Developer Comments

I approached the idea as a cork board with post its stickers on it, each new one will be placed on the right side of the last one added. Each idea has an edit and delete button, when a new idea added is placed at the end if there's no sorting type selected but on its right place when there is, when editing an idea it'll place it on the same position that it was before and then will sort all the ideas if a sorting type is selected. I created a few tests for IdeaBoard and IdeaCell. Eslint gives a few errors with the tests due to configuration but the rest is clean and styled. I added default properties to the components and accepted value types.

## A few improvements that can be made: 
save new/edited idea on enter, proper styles made by a professional designer, dragging of the post it, save it into the browser session/local storage, hand draw on the notes.

I hope this test shows the potential that I have as a front-end developer. I am looking forward to hear from you soon.
